# 5.1.1 Context-Free Grammars

一个_上下文无关文法_\(context-free grammar\)由一组_产生式_（productions）组成。每个产生式，左端（_left-hand side_）是一个被称为_非终结符_的抽象记号，右端（right-hand side）是

A _context-free grammar_ consists of a number of _productions_. Each production has an abstract symbol called a _nonterminal_ as its _left-hand side_, and a sequence of zero or more nonterminal and _terminal_ symbols as its _right-hand side_. For each grammar, the terminal symbols are drawn from a specified alphabet.

A chain production is a production that has exactly one nonterminal symbol on its right-hand side along with zero or more terminal symbols.

Starting from a sentence consisting of a single distinguished nonterminal, called thegoal symbol, a given context-free grammar specifies a _language_, namely, the \(perhaps infinite\) set of possible sequences of terminal symbols that can result from repeatedly replacing any nonterminal in the sequence with a right-hand side of a production for which the nonterminal is the left-hand side.上下文无关文法
